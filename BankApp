Easy Level
Description: Create a program where the user can input deposits into a bank account. The program should use if-else statements, input(), int() and while True loop to keep track of deposits.

Instructions:

Welcome the user to the bank
Initiate balance = 0
Ask the user to input the amount of money they want to deposit.
Add the deposit amount to the total balance
Ask the user if they want to make another deposit or exit the bank.
If they choose to make another deposit, repeat the process (while True).
If not, print the total amount deposited and exit the bank.
Medium Level
Instructions:

Use try and except to handle non-integer inputs for deposits.
Hard Level
Instructions:

Add bank withdrawal (if user wants to withdraw money the balance decreases)
If the balance becomes negative, withdrawal is not possible.
Add check balance optionality Example for hard level: print("\nWhat would you like to do?") print("1. Deposit money") print("2. Withdraw money") print("3. Check balance") print("4. Exit")


user_name = input('Please enter your name: ')
print(f'Welcome to the bank, {user_name}!')

balance = 0

while True:
    try:
        print('\n--------------------------')
        action = int(input("What would you like to do? \n  1 - Deposit money \n  2 - Withdraw money \n  3 - Check balance \n  4 - Exit \n"))
        if action == 1:
            deposit = int(input('What amount of money do you want to deposit: '))
            balance = balance + int(deposit)
            print(f'Your current balance: {balance} EUR')

        elif action == 2:
            withdrawal = int(input('What amount of money do you want to withdraw: '))
            if balance >= int(withdrawal):
                balance = balance - int(withdrawal)
                print(f'Your current balance: {balance} EUR')
            else:
                print('Impossible to wihdraw amount bigger than your current balance.')

        elif action == 3:
            print(f'Your current balance: {balance} EUR')

        elif action == 4:
            print(f'Bye, {user_name}!')
            break
    except:
            print('You can enter only numbers. \nTry again.')
